# KeyboardInteraction
Extremely simple website that will display the key that you type above the keyboard.
This was a small project I did for fun in order to help my JavaScript skills in assigning letters on the keyboard to light up the corresponding letters
on the virtual keyboard. This focuses mostly on the JavaScript aspect, but it also helped in my CSS skills with structuring the keyboard in order to resemble a 
keyboard. The codes for HTML, CSS, and JS are all listed and are available to everyone.
